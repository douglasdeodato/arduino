lcd pins

pin 1 to ground -   board

pin 2 to positive + board

pin 3 into the midle Potentiometer (10k)

pin 4 to to 12 arduino

pin 5 to ground

pin 6 to  jumper wire 11 arduino

pin 16 to ground in the board

pin 15  ( 220 resistor ) to positive in the board

pin 14  to jumper wire 2 arduino

pin 13 to pin 3 arduino

pin 12 to pin 4 arduino

pin 11 to pin 5 arduino

conect Potentiometer + and - into the board

last thing connect 5v and ground from arduino into your board.
